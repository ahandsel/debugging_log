## Roles in a webinar | [Zoom Help](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000252726)
  * **Host** of the webinar is the user who the webinar is scheduled under.
    * Has full permissions to manage the webinar, panelists, and attendees.
  * **Alternative Host** are users who have the same permissions as a Host.
    * They are assigned ahead of time & can start meetings.
  * **Co-hosts** share many of the controls that hosts have but cannot start the webinar.
    * The host must assign a co-host and can only be assigned during a meeting, and thus cannot start a meeting.
    * If a host needs someone else to start the webinar --> assign an alternative host.
  * **Panelists** are full participants in a webinar.
    * They can view and send video, screen share, annotate, etc.
    * Host must assign a panelist. --> [Inviting panelists to a webinar](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005657826)
  * **Attendees** are view-only participants who can be unmuted if the host chooses.
    * Can only interact with the host and the panelists through the Q&A and the chat.

## Zoom Meeting vs. Zoom Webinar
Here is a rundown of the differences between the two.

For more details, refer to the official Help Doc:
[Meeting and webinar comparison – Zoom Help Center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005474943-Meeting-and-webinar-comparison)

TL;DR
  * Webinar's Strength: Simpler interface for attendees, Q&A function, & Post attendee URL
  * Webinar's Weakness: Guests cannot turn on their cameras by default. Need to be promoted...

| Meeting                               | Webinar                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use for hosting small to large groups | Use for large events & public broadcasts (50+ attendees) |
| Sales meetings, training sessions     | Town halls, College lecture, Musical events              |
| Free & Paid subscriptions             | Extra cost as Paid Add-on                                |

## Zoom's Waiting Rooms Are Not Very Customizable
  * Only a tiny (100 x 100 px) logo can be placed.
    * ![Customize Waiting Room Screen Shot - Zoom_1.png](img/Zoom_1.png)
  * Text description can be added, but it is not clickable (users cannot click or copy a link).
  * [Waiting Room | Zoom's Help Doc](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room#h_57118d8b-1498-4c4c-a520-f8a5815930a7)
  * Waiting Room's Setting:

## Getting Attendees' Feedback Over Zoom
### Webinar - Use Post Webinar Survey
  * Allows us to redirect normal attendees to our survey website (or any URL) after they leave the Zoom Webinar. (does not work for panelists)
  * Unfortunately, it does not work for Meetings, only for Zoom Webinars.
  * The biggest drawback to Webinar is that only hosts and panelists can share their video (camera feed).
  * We can promote all the attendees to panelists, but it does not go smoothly.
  * ⚠ Post attendee URL is an alternative, but its performance is inconsistent. Many IT blogs recommend using the Post Webinar Survey method.

### Meeting - Use Poll
  * Create a Zoom Poll to collect feedback on how attendees are doing before the break.
  * [How To Use (In Meeting) Polling in Zoom - YouTube](https://youtu.be/erz4xtQHoVs?t=14)

## Sharing a Video on Zoom - Superior Method
1. Download the video in advance
   * I recommend [Folx - Download manager for Mac](https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html)
2. On Zoom:
   1. Click **Share Screen** ![share-screen-button-green.png](https://assets.zoom.us/generic-images/common-buttons-and-icons/filled/share-screen-button-green.png) located in your meeting controls.
   2. Switch to the **Advanced** tab
   3. Then select **Video** ![Video.png](https://assets.zoom.us/generic-images/desktop-client/in-meeting/Video.png)
   4. Navigate to and select the video you wish to share, then click **Open**
   5. The video will now open within Zoom and be visible to attendees!
