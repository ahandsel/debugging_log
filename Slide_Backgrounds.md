# Slide Backgrounds

## Unsplash

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a great website to look for images to use for a slide background.  
[Unsplash's License](https://unsplash.com/license) clearly states that all their photos are free to download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Although they appreciate credit, it is not required.

I edited several Unsplash photos to be used for slide backgrounds over in my Talk repo:

[github.com/ahandsel/Talks - ./public/background](https://github.com/ahandsel/Talks/tree/main/public/background)

Highly recommend building out a file to give credit to the creators!  
Good thing to do & keeps you from using photos you do not know where you got it from.
